# A ~~simple~~ textboard server
Implements a simple textboard protocol which (hopefully) was
written entirely for the purpose of torturing students.
The protocol is barely documented within the file
[task-description_en.pdf](task-description_en.pdf)

You can simply build the project using gradle or the IntelliJ
project files. Further build requirements and instructions
are located in [submission-readme.md](submission-readme.md)
(written in german).


## reference client
I've also included the reference client (sadly it's only
available as an obfuscated jar file). It's used like so:
```
java -jar reference-client.jar localhost 4242
```


## About this repository
This repository is the result of a slightly more complex than
usual university task which I solved due to some
procrastination issues mostly within two days (before the
deadline obviously :wink:).

I'll leave the repository here under the MIT License as a
reminder that things can become a _little_ messy if you
procrastinate your tasks until the
[panic monster](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arj7oStGLkU)
wakes up.
